# Kathy's Professional Portfolio

Put together in two days and eployed on Netlify at www.kathyadamsswe.com

As a software engineer searching for her first role in tech, I decided to take a break from job applications
to put together a website where I could showcase my skills and projects, and that I could easily share with 
potential employers and other professionals in my network. I used HTML5-Up's Astral template as the base, and
made changes and additions to suit my needs and aesthetics.

The following modifications were made to the initial template:

* Added slider of tech stack icons under portfolio tab using [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)
* Added links to projects in GitHub, represented by a screenshot image from each project
* Added title overlay to projects, activated when hovering over a project image
* Added Netlify email notification functionality to contact form
* Changed background image, and added personal headshot
* Added LinkedIn icon to tabs, which links directly to my LinkedIn profile

Expect more projects to be added soon, and thanks for looking!
